# Share button for social networks

Using this example you can add a custom button to the scene for redirecting to a specific page outside the experience. This is helpful for sharing social network links during the scenes interactions.

<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
  <image

    alt="Share button for social networks"
    caption="Share button for social networks" 
    style="border-radius: 12px;">
