# Add a screenshot capture button

Using this example you can add a custom button to capture screenshots of your scene once it's already loaded. This is very useful if you want to save certain screens about how your scene interaction looks like for each moment.

<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
  <image
    src="add-screenshot-capture-button.png"
    alt="Add a screenshot capture button"
    caption="Add a screenshot capture button" 
    style="border-radius: 12px;"
    >
</p>
